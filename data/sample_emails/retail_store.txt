Subject: Renewal Quote - Fashion Forward Boutique

Good morning,

I'm the owner of Fashion Forward Boutique and my current policy is coming up for renewal. I'd like to get a competitive quote.

About my business:
- Women's clothing and accessories retail store
- Located in a strip mall in suburban Atlanta, Georgia
- Been open for 6 years
- Annual sales around $850,000
- Just me and 4 part-time employees
- Store is 2,200 square feet, I lease the space
- Inventory value approximately $175,000
- No claims ever filed

Current coverage (looking for similar):
- General Liability $1M/$2M
- Business Personal Property
- Business Income coverage

I also have a small cargo van for picking up inventory from suppliers - would like to add that if possible.

My current premium is around $3,200/year and I'm hoping to stay in that range or lower if possible.

Renewal date is in 45 days.

Thank you,
Amanda Williams
