Subject: Coverage Request - CloudSync Technologies

Hi Insurance Team,

We're a SaaS company called CloudSync Technologies looking for our first commercial insurance package. Here are our details:

Company Info:
- Founded 3 years ago in Austin, Texas
- We develop cloud-based project management software
- Current ARR (annual recurring revenue): $4.5 million
- 35 employees, all W-2, mostly remote with a small office
- We handle customer data so cyber security is a priority

What we're looking for:
1. General Liability - standard limits
2. Professional Liability / E&O - we need this for our client contracts
3. Cyber Liability - at least $1M, preferably $2M
4. We have 3 company vehicles for sales team

Previous coverage: This is our first policy, previously relied on personal policies
Loss history: None

We're growing fast and want to make sure we're properly protected. Several of our enterprise clients are requiring proof of insurance in their contracts.

Timeline: Need this sorted within 2 weeks

Thanks,
Jennifer Chen
COO, CloudSync Technologies
