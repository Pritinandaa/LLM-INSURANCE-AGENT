Subject: Quote Request - ABC Construction Corp

Hi there,

I need a quote for ABC Construction Corp. They're a mid-size commercial construction company based in Texas, doing about $15M in annual revenue. They need General Liability coverage with $2M/$4M limits, plus Auto Liability for their fleet of 25 vehicles.

The company has been in business for 12 years, 85 employees. They've had two small workers comp claims in the past 3 years but nothing major. They're looking for coverage to start March 1st.

This is somewhat urgent - they're shopping around and want to make a decision by end of week.

Thanks,
