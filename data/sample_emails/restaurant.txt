Subject: Insurance Quote - Mario's Italian Kitchen

Hello,

I'm reaching out on behalf of Mario's Italian Kitchen, a family-owned restaurant in downtown Chicago. They've been serving the community for 8 years and are looking for a comprehensive insurance package.

Details:
- Full-service Italian restaurant
- Annual revenue: approximately $2.2 million
- 22 employees (mix of full-time and part-time)
- Square footage: 4,500 sq ft
- They have a full bar with liquor license (about 30% of revenue from alcohol)
- Open 7 days a week, 11am to 11pm
- No delivery service, dine-in and takeout only
- Building is leased, need tenant coverage
- Clean claims history - one slip and fall claim 4 years ago that was under $5,000

They need:
- General Liability ($1M/$2M)
- Property coverage for equipment and contents (approximately $350,000 value)
- Liquor Liability
- Workers Compensation

Hoping to have coverage in place by the 15th of next month for their lease renewal.

Best regards,
Michael Torres
